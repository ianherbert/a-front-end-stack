# A frontend stack

## Brief:
You just got a new job (congratulations). The old dev has decided to move to Portland, drink craft beer, and work on his mustache.

Before he left there were plans to upgrade the front-end of the company's site. Management remembers something about letters like npm, ES6, CCS, and YOLO, but have no idea what they mean. Your job is to review the existing upgrade plan and report back with your recommendations.

Existing upgrade plan:

We currently commit our third party JavaScript dependencies to the repo. We should totes use npm!
Our JavaScript is sooo last Wednesday, we need to start using ES6, like right now.
We need a build tool chain so we can do JavaScript unit testing, CSS pre-processing, and other cool stuff I havenâ€™t even thought of yet.

Management needs to know the benefits (and potential downsides) of these things. They  want it in the form of an implementation plan, incase you decide to leave too, and grow out your beard in the Alaskan backcountry. The plan should cover reasoning for using specific tools and provide comparisons with alternatives. Code snippets can be included if it helps to communicate the idea. The plan should be something another dev can pick up and get an understanding how it all fits together.
